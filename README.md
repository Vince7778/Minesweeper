# Minesweeper
This is just a personal project that I wanted to do.

## Features
* Minesweeper with 3 presets!
* Custom-sized boards! (Note: may be slow and unstable for larger boards)
* Challenge Mode with no flags allowed!
* Saving of best times for aforementioned presets!
* Terrible-looking graphics!
* Mildly readable code!

## Keyboard Controls
Use arrow keys or WASD to move your selector around the board.  
Use space or enter to reveal.  
Use the F key to flag a tile.
